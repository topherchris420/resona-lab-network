# Resona

**Where ideas find their frequency**

Resona is a next-generation open-source platform — a decentralized social network and research playground where scientists, engineers, and creators publish, share, and evolve frontier experiments together.

## 🌌 Vision

Resona is the **GitHub + Reddit + Hugging Face** of future science — a living network for open discovery.

- Users post research notes, code, data, and prototypes
- Others can **Resonate** with or **Fork** projects to evolve them further  
- Every project contributes to the world's first social graph of scientific resonance

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔬 Research Publishing
- Markdown-based project pages with syntax highlighting
- Upload code, datasets, and research documentation
- AI-powered auto-summarization and tagging
- Support for multiple license types (open, remixable, attribution)

### 🔊 Social Resonance
- **Resonate** — Like projects that inspire you
- **Fork** — Create derivative works and evolutions
- **Discuss** — Collaborative comment threads
- Track resonance scores and scientific impact

### 👥 Community & Collaboration
- User profiles with resonance graphs
- Public Labs for team collaboration
- Follow researchers and topics
- Discover related projects through AI recommendations

### 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: Sleek, dark, minimal, and luminous
- **Colors**: Deep black with cyan, violet, and silver gradients
- **Motion**: Smooth animations and particle effects
- **Typography**: Modern, clean (Inter font family)
- **Background**: Animated particles representing live resonance
